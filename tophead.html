Main Components of the Top Head Assembly

Cylinder Head (Main Casting)

The metal body (usually aluminum or cast iron) that bolts to the engine block.

Contains ports, valve seats, and combustion chambers.

Valves

Intake valves let the air-fuel mixture in.

Exhaust valves let burnt gases out.

Valve Springs and Retainers

Keep the valves closed and return them to position after opening.

Camshaft (or Camshafts)

Operates the valves using lobes that push on lifters or rocker arms.

In DOHC (Double Overhead Cam) engines, there are usually two camshafts per head — one for intake and one for exhaust.

Rocker Arms or Lifters

Transfer motion from the camshaft to the valves (varies by design).

Head Gasket

A crucial seal between the cylinder head and the block, keeping combustion pressure, oil, and coolant separate.

Spark Plugs or Injectors

Spark plugs ignite the mixture (in gasoline engines).

Injectors deliver fuel directly (in diesel or direct-injection gasoline engines).

🔩 Functions

Forms the combustion chamber with the pistons and block.

Manages air and fuel intake and exhaust gas exit.

Houses valve timing components (camshafts, lifters, etc.).

Channels coolant and oil for temperature control and lubrication.<p>
