Types of Camshaft Configurations

OHV (Overhead Valve / Pushrod)

Camshaft is located inside the engine block.

Uses pushrods and rocker arms to operate valves.

OHC (Overhead Camshaft)

Camshaft is located in the cylinder head.

Directly actuates valves or uses short rocker arms.

DOHC (Double Overhead Camshaft)

Two camshafts per cylinder head — one for intake and one for exhaust valves.

Common in modern engines for better performance and efficiency.

🛠️ Functions of a Camshaft

Controls valve timing (when valves open and close).

Determines engine breathing, affecting power and efficiency.

Works with the crankshaft via the timing system to keep engine cycles synchronized.<p>
