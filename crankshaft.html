Main Parts of a Crankshaft

Main Journals

The parts of the crankshaft that sit in the main bearings of the block.

Support the crankshaft and allow it to rotate smoothly.

Crankpins (Rod Journals)

Offset from the main journals.

The connecting rods attach here — this offset is what creates the crank throw, turning piston movement into rotation.

Crank Webs (Arms)

The solid portions connecting main journals to crankpins.

Help balance and strengthen the crankshaft.

Counterweights

Balance the crankshaft by offsetting the weight of the connecting rods and pistons, reducing vibration.

Thrust Washers

Control the crankshaft’s end play (forward–backward movement).

Oil Passages

Internal channels that carry oil to lubricate bearings and journals.

Flywheel Mount (Rear End)

Bolts to the flywheel or flexplate, connecting the crankshaft to the transmission.

Crank Pulley (Front End)

Drives belts for accessories like the alternator, water pump, or power steering.

🔩 Function Summary

Converts reciprocating motion → rotary motion.

Drives the flywheel, timing system, and engine accessories.

Helps maintain engine balance and smoothness.

🛠️ Materials

Usually made of forged steel or cast iron for strength and durability.

High-performance engines may use billet steel or forged alloy crankshafts. <p>
