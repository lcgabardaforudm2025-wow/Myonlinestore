🔧 Main Functions

Houses cylinders: where pistons move up and down to create power.

Supports major components: like the crankshaft, camshaft, and sometimes the oil pump.

Contains coolant and oil passages: to regulate temperature and lubrication.

Provides mounting points: for the head, oil pan, and transmission.

⚙️ Main Parts of an Engine Block

Cylinders – The holes where pistons slide; precision-machined for tight sealing.

Cylinder liners (sleeves) – Optional inserts that can be replaced or repaired.

Crankcase – The lower section that houses the crankshaft.

Water jackets – Channels around the cylinders where coolant flows.

Oil galleries – Passages that deliver oil to moving parts.

Deck surface – The top surface where the cylinder head attaches.

🧱 Materials

Cast iron – Strong and durable; used in heavy-duty engines.

Aluminum alloy – Lighter and better heat dissipation; used in modern cars. <p>
